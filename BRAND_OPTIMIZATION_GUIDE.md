# Brand Optimization Guide - Removing "Vercel" from Google Search Results

## 🎯 Problem Identified

"Vercel" is appearing prominently in your Google search results instead of your brand "Git Master". This happens because:

1. **Domain Contains "vercel.app"**: Your URL includes the hosting platform name
2. **Insufficient Brand Signals**: Not enough emphasis on your brand in metadata
3. **Hosting Platform Recognition**: Google recognizes Vercel as the hosting provider

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Brand Emphasis in SEO

#### Updated SEO Configuration (`src/lib/seo-config.ts`)
- **Brand-First Keywords**: "git master", "git master platform" prioritized
- **Enhanced Titles**: `"Title - Git Master | Interactive Git Learning Platform"`
- **Branded Descriptions**: Include "Git Master - The leading platform..." 
- **Brand Configuration**: Centralized brand identity management

#### Key Changes:
```typescript
// Before: Generic title
const fullTitle = `${title} | Git Master`

// After: Brand-emphasized title
const fullTitle = `${title} - ${brandConfig.name} | ${brandConfig.tagline}`
```

### 2. Comprehensive Structured Data

#### Multiple Schema Types Added:
- **WebApplication**: Emphasizes your platform over hosting
- **Organization**: Establishes Git Master as the entity
- **Course**: Positions as educational provider

#### Brand-Focused Schema:
```json
{
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Git Master",
  "alternateName": "Git Master Platform",
  "description": "Leading interactive platform for Git education",
  "knowsAbout": ["Git version control", "Developer education"]
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Meta Tags

#### Brand-Specific Tags Added:
- `application-name`: "Git Master"
- `apple-mobile-web-app-title`: "Git Master"
- Multiple structured data scripts for brand authority

## 🔍 SEO Strategy Changes

### Title Structure Optimization
```
Before: "Interactive Git Terminal | Git Master"
After:  "Interactive Git Terminal - Git Master | Interactive Git Learning Platform"
```

### Description Enhancement
```
Before: "Execute real Git commands in our interactive terminal"
After:  "Execute real Git commands in our interactive terminal | Git Master - The leading platform for interactive Git learning"
```

### Keyword Prioritization
